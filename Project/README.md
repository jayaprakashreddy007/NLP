# Article Summarization and Categorization

### Team Members
* Divya Geethanjali Birudharaju
* Jaya Prakash Reddy Gade
* Ayyappa Ankishetty

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is, we find few articles on Instagram, Blog or any social platform but it would be difficult for us to find what is in the article before reading it. Sometimes, after seeing the length of the article, we lose interest and stop reading it. But, if the article is about one of our interests, we might miss reading it. So, if there is a tool which categorizes and summarizes articles, it would be a time saving for most of the people. We can read the article if it is about our interested topic. We can skip reading the article if it is not in our interested category.

### Significance
